        <p>
          Iâ€™m so grateful that my kids have you as their aunt. Youâ€™re an
          incredible example to them of dilegence, basketball skill, and determination. I know
          they look up to you in many ways. Thank you for being there for them and
          being willing to play with Eden and to hold baby Conley. Hereâ€™s to all
          the amazing adventures awaiting you this year and beyond.
        </p>
